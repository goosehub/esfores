			<h2>Tribune Online</h2>
			<p>Hello. I'm J. Jonah Jameson. I founded the S4S Tribune on June 9th, 2013, as a weekly online newspaper for the 4chan community [s4s]. After 7 issues I took a hiatus. I returned on April 1st, 2014 with Tribune, a monthly online memezine. It ran for four issues. I again took another hiatus, and in November of 2014, launched Tribune online, in conjunction with esfores.com. This website serves as a platform for sharing any and all information about things happening on [s4s], 4chan, and the world wide web as a whole, particually minor discussion boards.</p>
			<p>I am constantly seeking fellows to work with on my projects. I can not make this website possible by myself. As well as depending on ebbin content for users, I seek web designers, php programmers, visual designers, data analytics specialists, full time and freelance journalists, marketing specialists, advertisers, public relations, customer service representatives, and janitorial staff.</p>
			<p>If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at <strong>s4stribune@gmail.com</strong> or as <strong>GooseTube</strong> on skype. To help develop this website, take a look at the code at <a href="https://github.com/interplayxyz/tribune"><strong>GitHub</strong></a></p>
